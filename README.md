# GameOfThrones_Mania

This app gives the user opportunities to read quotes from various characters from the Game of Thrones(GOT) franchise. 
GOT is a popular series world wide and the avid supporters are always looking for captions for their posts and this is where this app will defintely have a large fan base to tap into.

I made use of a free api for the GOT quotes which can be found at https://github.com/shevabam/game-of-thrones-quotes-api

The Platform capability that my app utilizes is it allows the user to share random quotes via the devices email platform.

To run this app locally I used the terminal command:
cd GameOfThrones_Mania
expo start
w (This will open the app in your web browser-There are options for ios and android in the builds folder)

A web page will open up and this will be your access to test the app.
